# ðŸ§¬ Multimodal Healthcare Data Generator

This project generates synthetic multimodal healthcare data for research and development in medical AI applications. It aims to provide realistic, privacy-safe datasets that include:

## ðŸ”§ Functionality

- **Structured Data**: Simulates Electronic Health Records (EHR), including patient demographics, vitals, diagnoses, and lab results.
- **Unstructured Text**: Generates clinical notes and doctor observations using medically relevant language.
- **Medical Images**: Produces placeholder or synthetic medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRI scans) for testing image-based models.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Control number of samples, patient attributes, disease types, and more.
- **Multi-format Export**: Outputs data in CSV or JSON formats for easy integration into pipelines.
- **Use Cases**:
  - AI/ML model training and testing
  - Prototyping healthcare analytics tools
  - Educational and demonstration purposes without using real patient data
